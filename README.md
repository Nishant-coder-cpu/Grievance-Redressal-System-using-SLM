## What is ResolveAI?

ResolveAI is a **next-generation grievance redressal system** that combines artificial intelligence with human oversight to create a fair, transparent, and efficient complaint resolution process. Unlike traditional systems that rely on manual triage and static rules, ResolveAI brings intelligence to every step of the complaint lifecycle.

<details>
<summary><b>The Problem We Solve</b></summary>

Traditional grievance systems suffer from:
- **Slow Manual Triage**: Human reviewers create bottlenecks
- **Inconsistent Categorization**: Depends on individual judgment
- **Poor Prioritization**: Critical issues get buried in queues
- **No Learning**: Systems never improve from past cases
- **Lack of Transparency**: Users don't know what to expect

</details>

---

## Features

### Intelligent AI Classification

<details>
<summary><b>Confidence-Aware Routing with Human-in-the-Loop</b></summary>



- AI generates predictions **with confidence scores**
- High confidence leads to automatic routing
- Low confidence triggers human review
- Prevents silent AI errors and builds trust

**How it works:**
```
Confidence >= 85%  → Auto-route to department
Confidence 50-85%  → Triage officer review
Confidence < 50%   → Manual review queue
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Feedback-Driven Continuous Learning</b></summary>



- Authorities can confirm or correct AI predictions
- System learns from institutional expertise
- Adapts to unique terminology and context
- Self-improving over time

**Learning Cycle:**
1. AI makes prediction
2. Authority confirms or corrects
3. Feedback stored as structured data
4. Model refinement in controlled cycles
5. Improved accuracy over time

</details>

---

### Smart Prioritization

<details>
<summary><b>Dynamic SLA Estimation</b></summary>



Calculates realistic resolution times based on:
- Complaint severity
- Historical patterns
- Current department workload

**Formula:**
```
SLA_dynamic = (SLA_base / (1 + SeverityScore)) + (γ × N_queue)
```

**Example:**
- Critical complaint (severity=10)
- Base SLA = 24 hours
- Department queue = 8 pending cases
- Result: ~6.2 hours estimated resolution

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Community Signal-Driven Urgency</b></summary>



- Users can like and comment on public complaints
- Rapid engagement auto-escalates severity
- Systemic issues surface faster
- Safeguards prevent gaming the system

**Escalation Formula:**
```
E = (Likes / (Time + 1)^α) × User_Weight

If E > threshold → Auto-escalate to Critical
```

**Safeguards:**
- Engagement only influences within limits
- Suspicious patterns trigger reviews
- Balanced user role weights
- Cannot override genuine critical issues

</details>

## Development & Testing with Requestly

### API-First Development Approach

ResolveAI was developed using **Requestly** as the primary API command center during development and testing. Instead of relying on the frontend UI for validation, all critical backend and AI workflows were designed, tested, and debugged directly using the Requestly API Client.

<details>
<summary><b>Why Requestly Was Essential</b></summary>

ResolveAI consists of multiple interacting components:
- A Node.js backend handling business logic
- A FastAPI-based AI service performing complaint classification
- Strict JSON-based contracts between services

Testing such a system purely through the UI is slow and error-prone. Requestly allowed us to:
- Directly test APIs in isolation
- Simulate edge cases without UI constraints
- Validate AI behavior with precision
- Debug complex multi-service interactions

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>API Collection Organization</b></summary>

Requestly collections were organized by responsibility:

**Health & Diagnostics**
- `GET /health` – Verify AI service availability and model loading

**AI Classification**
- `POST /classify` – Single complaint classification
- `POST /classify/batch` – Batch complaint processing
- `POST /explain` – Explainability endpoint for admin insights

**Failure & Edge Cases**
- Empty complaint text
- Ambiguous complaints
- Multi-category complaints
- High-risk harassment scenarios

Each request was saved with example payloads and expected responses, creating a reusable and well-documented API workspace.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Complex Request Construction</b></summary>

Requestly was used to construct non-trivial POST requests with structured JSON bodies.

**Example single complaint payload:**
```json
{
  "complaint": "The water cooler on the third floor is broken and feels unsafe"
}
```

**Example batch testing payload:**
```json
{
  "complaints": [
    "Professor is threatening students over grades",
    "WiFi not working in hostel block B",
    "Water leakage near electrical panel"
  ]
}
```

This allowed us to validate:
- Multi-category detection
- Severity assignment
- SLA calculation logic
- Correct department routing

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Endpoint Validation & Debugging</b></summary>

Requestly was heavily used to:
- Verify response schemas matched the expected Pydantic models
- Ensure strict JSON output from the AI service
- Check HTTP status codes for success and failure cases
- Inspect response timing to identify slow inference paths

When classification failed or returned unexpected output, Requestly made it easy to:
- Replay the exact same request
- Compare outputs before and after logic changes
- Debug fallback mechanisms without UI interference

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Testing AI Logic Without UI Dependency</b></summary>

Using Requestly, we validated:
- Confidence-aware routing logic
- Escalation rules for critical complaints
- Anonymous submission recommendations
- SLA calculations based on severity

This ensured the AI and backend logic were correct before being integrated into the frontend, significantly reducing debugging time.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Workflow Efficiency & Impact</b></summary>

Requestly improved development speed and reliability by:
- Acting as a single source of truth for API behavior
- Allowing rapid iteration on AI prompts and parsing logic
- Making backend validation independent of frontend readiness
- Enabling repeatable, deterministic testing of sensitive grievance scenarios

For a system handling privacy-sensitive and high-impact complaints, this level of API-level validation was essential.

</details>

### Summary

Requestly was not used as a simple request sender, but as a **professional-grade API testing and validation platform**. It enabled faster debugging, cleaner architecture, and higher confidence in AI-driven decision-making—making it a critical part of the ResolveAI development workflow.

## Mathematical Foundations

<details>
<summary><b>Dynamic SLA Formula</b></summary>



```
SLA_dynamic = (SLA_base / (1 + SeverityScore)) + (γ × N_queue)
```

**Where:**
- `SLA_base`: Standard baseline time (e.g., 24 hours for Critical)
- `SeverityScore`: 1 (Normal), 3 (High), 10 (Critical)
- `N_queue`: Number of pending complaints in department
- `γ`: Time delay factor per queued item (e.g., 0.5 hours)

**Purpose:** Balances urgency with realistic capacity constraints

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Community Escalation Score</b></summary>



```
E = (L / (T + 1)^α) × W_user
```

**Where:**
- `L`: Number of likes/upvotes
- `T`: Time since submission (hours)
- `α`: Decay factor (prioritizes recent engagement)
- `W_user`: User role weight (Student=1, Faculty=2, Staff=1.5)

**Purpose:** Amplifies widespread issues while preventing old complaints from dominating

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Confidence-Based Routing</b></summary>



```
Route =
  If C >= 0.85  → Predicted Department (auto)
  If 0.50 ≤ C < 0.85  → Triage Officer
  If C < 0.50  → Manual Review Queue
```

**Where:**
- `C`: Model confidence score (0 to 1)

**Purpose:** Ensures automation only where AI is reliable

</details>
